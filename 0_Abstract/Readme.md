# TITLE OF PROJECT
# WIPER CONTROLLER SYSTEM
## BRIEF INTRODUCTION 
The car industry has been intensively researching ways to harness modern computing and electronic developments in the development of safety, dependability, and entertainment technologies for the past two decades. Despite this, for a variety of reasons, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems are rather uncommon in modern vehicles. In new cars, they are frequently too pricey, unattractive, or unreliable to be desirable. Many attempts have been made to develop an effective, dependable, and inexpensive rain detection and wiper control system that adjusts the vehicle's speed and intermittent interval automatically based on the amount of rain. Optical sensors are commonly used to monitor the amount of water.
The fact that the refraction angle and amount of light reflection varies when the two windshields are moist is used in this sort of sensor. Despite their widespread use, optical sensors have several drawbacks. The sensitivity to external light is one of the drawbacks. Another issue arises when driving at night, via tunnels, or even in underground parking. Many systems still engage the wiper as the automobile exits tunnels or underground parking lots for this reason. Another flaw, possibly the most serious, is that the sensing area is a small piece of the windshield. As a result, the system can only operate in a small region. 
The wiper system may fail to activate when there are some raindrops on the driverâ€™s line of sight, but not on the sensing area. They are often too expensive, too unsightly, or too unreliable to be desired in new automobiles.
#HISTORY OF WIPER CONTOLLER
##1903: Mary Anderson patents the first windshield wiper
Mary Anderson, a real estate developer, cattle rancher, and winemaker, patented the first windshield wiper in 1903. Anderson witnessed the streetcar operator labouring with extremely poor visibility while riding a streetcar in New York City in 1902 during a thunderstorm, prompting him to open his window and thrust his head out. When Anderson saw this, he immediately started designing a windshield wiper that the driver might use to aid enhance visibility.
##1919: The automatic windshield wiper is introduced
Windshield wipers were not standard equipment on most vehicles until 1916, allowing for further technological developments.
In 1919, inventor William M. Folberth developed the first automatic, non-hand-driven windshield wipers. The vacuum-powered technology utilised by these automatic windshield wipers to clear the windshield became standard equipment on automobiles. Until the 1960s, when intermittent wipers became more widespread, this vacuum-powered technology was extensively utilised.
##1969: Robert Kearns introduces the intermittent windshield wiper
Various innovators patented the notion of intermittent wipers over many decades, but it was thanks to Robert Kearns, an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, that the concept actually took root. When Kearns proposed manufacturing the idea, he brought it to the attention of Ford Motor Company. While this concept resulted in a patent fight between the American carmaker and Kearns, it also led to the development of modern windshield wipers.
##Today: Windshield wipers everywhere!
Now, windshield wipers are commonplace on vehicles and a variety of options are available. The automotive industry has even introduced rain-sensing wipers that start themselves. With this technology, the view of the road is sure to stay clear.
# OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
* Windshield wipers may be a little component of your vehicle, but they have a significant impact on your driving and overall safety.
* At the touch of a button, they remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost, and other debris fast and smoothly!
* The wiper arms are moved across the windshield by the windshield wiper motor. The metal or hard plastic arms pull a thin rubber (or silicone) blade over the windshield to clean water from the lens, allowing you to see the road better.
* Wiper blades break, rip, and lose their flexibility and functionality with time. Wipers are harmed by a variety of factors, including road grit, bird droppings, severe temperatures, and UV light.
#  FUNCTIONALITY
* When the ignition is on and the button/ switch is pressed for 2 sec the system is activated 
* The Red colour LED start glowing and indicate the system is in active .
* The diffrent coloue of LED i.e Green , Orange, Blue is used to indicate the speed of wiper .
* The  Wiper Moving at 1 H,2Hz,3Hz.
* while the button is pressed again for 2 sec than the Red lED stop glowing and indicate that the system is off.
